# wasm-hello
Just a small test of WebAssembly, with Rust and (of course) Javascript. Do NOT use this in production or something like that. This is only a demo/tutorial and the wasm has not been optimize. Many thanks to Mozilla for the tutorial (found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm). I only slightly modyfied it. 

## How to run

Fire up some local server ( I used Visual Code's Live server), and access the index.html. If it works you should se an alert saying Hello World.
